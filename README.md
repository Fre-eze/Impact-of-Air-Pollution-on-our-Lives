# Impact-of-Air-Pollution-on-our-Lives

This is my first internship in Analystics, worked as an Data Analyst intern. I had to analyse Data in two fragments : Pre Corona [2016 to 2020] from Data available at different sources and Post Corona [2020 to 2023] by extrapolating the current shift during lockdown and expected recovery & changes post corona, analysing different factors which affect this trend and ultimate reflection and impact of this on our lives.
I had choosen to work on Impact of Air Pollution on our Lives [Vehicular and Industrial Pollution to be taken as key point].
